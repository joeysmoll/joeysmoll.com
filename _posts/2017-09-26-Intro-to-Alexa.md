title: Joey, meet Alexa

Alexa and I have had our share of casual and productive interactions recently, sometimes she plays me some sweet sweet music, sometimes she wakes me up ensuring I have a productive morning, or most importantly, tells me to get my clothes from the dryer because the only thing worse than wrinkly clothes is the act of removing them wrinkles. We've known one another for a few weeks now and things have been going great, but I wanted more. I wanted a peek under the hood, if you know what I mean.

What is it that makes Alexa tick? She does all these great things for me, but I'm not just going to sit back and take, take, take. I'm a provider gosh darn it (Alexa is not big on swearing) and I'm going to contribute to this relationship. Now what's better than passing on valuable knowledge and improving Alexa's ability to answer some of the universe's most perplexing questions, hell, let's call this knowledge a particular set of skills (as I channel Taken's Liam Neeson). So what valuable skills you might ask. I'm going to teach Alexa how to play MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) Trivia. Okay, maybe a sport centered around combat and violence is not super high on Alexa's list of priorities, but I like MMA and that's that.

I know what you're thinking, it's not easy teaching something as profoundly complex as who has the longest UFC winning streak or which UFC fighter has been knocked out the most to Alexa. WRONG! Due to some connections ([Bloc](bloc.io)) on the not so deep web I came a across a template, not just any template, but a [trivia template](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia). Just plug in the questions and Voil√†! I can be playing MMA Trivia with Alexa for minutes upon minutes.

The trivia template was brilliantly laid out. I do have some experience with some of the tools to teach new skills to Alexa, but this template was never short of providing links to useful resources and videos. If a link was needed for further elaboration, it was there. All of the steps were clear and if there was point a where you could encounter an error, the template anticipated it and asked questions to help the user troubleshoot. This template showed me how I would adapt Alexa skills in multiple languages from English to the sophisticated UK English. The template takes you through the whole process from setting up your accounts to start creating new skills to sending your skills off for certification, so they will appear in the [Alexa Skill Store](https://www.alexaskillstore.com/). You won't be left hanging.  

I think it'd be a stretch to have any major gripes with the template. Only thing I recommend would be updating a few screenshots of the template. The Alexa Skill Information screen shot is a bit different now. The Amazon Web Services home page is different now. There isn't a Blank Function Blueprint for Lambda functions, now it's an Author from scratch button. There is Node.js 6.10 runtime now which almost aligns with Node's current LTS version. The Alexa Skill Configuration tab looks different now. The template could have recommended the [7Zip application](7-zip.org) to zip up important files. But all in all this really demonstrates how fast the Alexa development space is changing and evolving which is actually promising if anything.

After getting my feet wet a bit, there is so much I want to do and experience. Like what goes into a creating a flash briefing? How do I get Alexa to play a specific audio or video file? What is it like developing a visual skill for the Amazon Show? What's it like working with Dynamo DB? What are some skills I want my Alexa to have? What are some skills many people wish their Alexa had? This is just the beginning and expect more, much more.

Thanks for reading. 

Alexa, open MMA Trivia.
