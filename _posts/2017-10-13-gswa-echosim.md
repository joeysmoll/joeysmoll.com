**TL;DR: It’s okay, but I'd steer clear.** 

I was interested in Alexa development before actually owning and using an Amazon Echo or other Alexa-enabled devices. Surprisingly, I found out it wasn’t a requirement to own Alexa hardware to test and develop [Alexa Skills](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=13727921011). Developers can use [Echosim.io](https://echosim.io/welcome) to test their Alexa skills in the browser at no cost. 

Echosim.io is a great cost-effective service, but does have its limitations. Echosim doesn’t replicate a normal interaction with Alexa, the user will have to hold down a button on their keyboard or on the web page and say a command. Most Alexa users have their Echo devices set to hands-free mode so that Alexa is ready to respond commands. So understanding how you interact with Alexa provides valuable data points in how others users may interact with their devices. Due to Echosim requiring a browser, developers may be limited to use cases that apply to their office and bedroom environments, and Alexa is intended to be used in a variety of places, such as the kitchen, living-room, garage, etc. Another downside is Echosim is slow and doesn’t give the user a realistic idea of how fast their skill will actually work and will cause the testing process to be slower in general. Unless you can't afford some hardware, I wouldn't recommend Echosim.io.
