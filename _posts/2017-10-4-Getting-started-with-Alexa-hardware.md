**TL;DR: Get it, use it, learn it.**

This series of “Getting Started with Alexa” is about the route I took and am still on in learning Alexa development and other voice technologies. I will present recommendations, but much like in every corner in software development, there are many different paths to take to end up in the same desired place. To keep up with Alexa’s always evolving space, I recommend checking out the [Alexa Blog](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/) to hear about recent developments in the community. I hope you find bits and pieces of value within these posts.

If you are not already, I would recommend developers getting familiar with all the different [Amazon Echo and Alexa devices](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b?ie=UTF8&node=9818047011). I think Amazon does a good job of offering devices that vary in price point and utility that appeal to different demographics. The [Echo Dot](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DFKC2SO?ref=ODS_HA_B_surl&tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=226613413367&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1917776945554641835&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030008&hvtargid=kwd-296997964291&ref=pd_sl_4ee0m9kexv_e) is the cheapest solution and will work just fine for all audio related skills. On the opposite side of the spectrum we have the [Echo Show](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J24C0TI?tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=227508954212&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2238288922823346241&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030008&hvtargid=kwd-310736619495&ref=pd_sl_1foyxz097s_e) which is the most expensive device and utilizes a screen for video calls and interfaces for different skills. So choose a device that is right for you and hit the ground running. 

My weapon of choice was a refurbished [Amazon Tap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BH83OOM)(discounted $50 from normal price) due to its mobility, decent speaker, and mid-range price point. With the Tap’s internal battery it allowed me to get an idea what it would be like using Alexa in different parts of my house. Once you have your device, you should get familiar with the [Alexa app](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P03D4D2/?tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=181928369660&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=17394723695098320277&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030008&hvtargid=kwd-33514032209&ref=pd_sl_932wwntapj_e_p20) and try out some skills from the [Alexa Skills store](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=13727921011) to get an idea how others are using their devices.
